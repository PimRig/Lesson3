				Characteristics
			</h1>
			<p>
				<span class="sent-start">Bees differ from closely related groups</span> such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (hairs),<br> combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in limb structure,<br> and the venation of the hind wings; and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.

						<span class="sent-start">The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(biology)">antennae</a> usually have </span> 13 segments in males and 12 in females, and are geniculate,<br> having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors),<br> smell and taste; and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to "hear" sounds.

				<span class="sent-start">The ethologist</span> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Frisch">Karl von Frisch</a> studied navigation in the honey bee. He showed that honey bees communicate by the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance">waggle dance</a>,<br> in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive. He demonstrated that bees can recognize<br> a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)">polarization</a> pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth's magnetic field.<br> He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beehive">beehive</a>.<br> Bees navigate using spatial memory with a "rich, map-like organization

				<span class="sent-start">Homer's</span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Hymns">Hymn to Hermes</a> describes three bee-maidens with the power of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divination">Divination</a> and thus speaking truth,<br> and identifies the food of the gods as honey. Sources associated the bee maidens with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo">Apollo</a> and, until the 1980s,<br> scholars followed Gottfried Hermann (1806) in incorrectly identifying the bee-maidens with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriae">Thriae</a>.<br> Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa (" Bee" ); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from Mycenean times.<br> Bees were also associated with the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia">Delphic oracle</a> and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.<br>
				The image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times, in Aristotle and Plato;<br> in Virgil and Seneca; in Erasmus and Shakespeare; Tolstoy, and by political and social theorists such as Bernard Mandeville and<br> Karl Marx as a model for human society.

					<span class="sent-start">Some of the oldest examples</span> of bees in art are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting">rock paintings</a> in Spain which have been dated to 15,000 BC.<br>
					<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats">W. B. Yeats's</a> poem <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lake_Isle_of_Innisfree">The Lake Isle of Innisfree</a> (1888) contains the couplet "Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee,<br> And live alone in the bee loud glade." At the time he was living in Bedford Park in the West of London. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Potter">Beatrix Potter's</a> illustrated book<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_Mrs._Tittlemouse">The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse </a>(1910) features Babbity Bumble and her brood (pictured). <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Williams">Kit Williams</a> treasure hunt book <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bee_on_the_Comb">The Bee on the Comb</a> (1984)<br> uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Monk_Kidd">Sue Monk Kidd's</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Bees_(novel)">The Secret Life of Bees</a> (2004), and the 2009 film starring Dakota Fanning,<br> tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers, the Boatwrights.
					The humorous 2007<br> animated film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and was his first work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Ren√©e Zellweger. Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame. Dave Goulson's A Sting in the Tale (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in Britain,<br> as well as much about their biology. The playwright Laline Paull's fantasy The Bees (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named Flora 717 from hatching onwards.
